# Disclaimer

Even though we carefully check the entries before they are verified, we cannot assume any liability for errors.
For example, no claims can be made against TransDB,
if a health insurance does not cover the costs for a needle epilation studio
or other services noted on the site are not provided by the respective providers.
Furthermore, despite careful examination, we cannot assume any liability for linked contents of other websites.

The TransDB project is intended to make it easier for trans\* people to gain access to adequate medical care and to connect with the community.
TransDB is community-based. It is open to everyone to help with the project.
This means that people who have had good experiences with services can share them with others to make the search easier.
The project is based solely on unpaid work and donations.
We are therefore explicitly non-commercial.
