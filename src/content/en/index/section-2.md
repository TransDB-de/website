The Trans\*DB project lives from the community and all trans\* people who share their experiences with others.

We hope to be able to present as many good offers as possible in the future,
to facilitate a possible transition for trans\* people from all over Germany.

So if you know helpful doctors, therapists, trans\* groups or other contacts,
which are not yet available through our search, we would be very happy if you could add your experiences to our database.
