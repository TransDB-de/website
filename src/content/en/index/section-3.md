On behalf of all trans\* people, we would like to thank you for every entry that helps others to potentially accelerate their transition, reduce gatekeeping and discrimination, and connect with the trans\* community.

If you would like to support Trans*DB beyond your entries, we would be very happy if you share our link with others.
Also, feel free to contact us to contribute to our project in other ways!
We are always looking for people to help build and maintain our website, to search for information or to write texts for our website.

You can also support us with a donation to finance the project.
