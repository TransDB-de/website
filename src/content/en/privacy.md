# Privacy policy

Please be aware that we, TransDB.com, have no control over the content or privacy practices of websites linked to our site.
Thus, this privacy policy is limited to subpages that are directly on our domain (TransDB.com).

## Cloudflare

We use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) as DDoS protection.

To make this possible, all requests to our website go through Cloudflare.
Cloudflare logs data in this process to verify if an attack is taking place.
This data includes but is not limited to:

- Your IP address
- Type of your browser and device

You can find out exactly what data is collected and stored in the [Cloudflare "Privacy Policy"](https://www.cloudflare.com/de-de/privacypolicy/).

Also note [Cloudsflare's GDPR Compliance](https://www.cloudflare.com/de-de/gdpr/introduction/).

## User statistics

We use [Ackee](https://ackee.electerious.com/) for anonymous user statistics.
This software runs directly on our server and is not hosted externally.

Ackee stores the following data among others:

- What browser you are using
- Referral link (from where you came to our website)
- Type of your device

The data stored by Ackee is not personally identifiable.  
It is only used to make our site more user friendly.

No IP address is stored.

## Logging

In case of a malfunction, the error logging of our server may temporarily store the IP address, the type of browser, and the type of device of visitors.
This data is not made public.

It will only be used to better understand how the malfunction occurred and will be deleted as soon as the malfunction has been fixed.

## Cookies

TransDB.de does not use tracking cookies and does not use external scripts that use tracking cookies.

## Google Fonts

The fonts our website uses are open source and originally come from Google Fonts.
We do not use the Google Font API, but host the data ourselves.
So no connection is made to Google servers and no data is passed to Google.

## Location

TransDB.de uses a location search, where you can either enter your location manually or let the browser capture your coordinates.
This feature is optional and will not be executed without the user's consent.

The location search is done by our own server. Your location will not be shared with third parties.
Our location search does not store the searched location.
