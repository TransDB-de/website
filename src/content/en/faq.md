# Frequently asked questions

## What does the "DB" in "Trans*DB" mean?

DB stands for DataBase.

## Does Trans*DB also work in other countries?

It is possible to submit a new entry whose location is not in Germany.  
However, the area search currently only works in Germany.

## Why does my entry not show up in the search?

When a new entry is submitted, it must first be checked and activated by one of our team members.

## An entry that was once in the search is gone. Where does this come from?

In some cases we delete entries.  
This can happen in case of:

- Demonstrably false information, if we can't find any others
- Negative experience reports
- If the indicated persons / contacts want to have their entry deleted

## Why are entries outside my city displayed?

The proximity search does not filter by a city, but displays all matching entries in ascending distance to your (selected) location.

## Why do I only see entries from places that are far away?

Make sure that you have entered your location correctly. Above you can see by which location the system filters. You can also use your browser's location data by clicking on the "Area search" button.

It is also possible that there are no entries in your area yet - hopefully this will change soon!

## Why are some entries shown twice?

With us, contact points can appear more than once if they fall into several categories.
For example, there are therapists who are also experts.
For these cases, the entry exists once for each appropriate category.

## Why is the information of the entries still in german?

The information of the entries is submitted by the users and translation of dynamic user generated data is currently not possible.  
Also, since Trans*DB is currently primarily designed for entries and users from Germany, corresponding information is also from Germany and thus mostly in German.

## Do you make the data available for download or provide an API?

No, we have deliberately decided against this. 
Automated processing by third parties has great potential for abuse. There is a risk that the institutions would then want to have their entries removed due to misuse, automated processing and/or spam. This would not help anyone.

## Do you establish contacts to facilities?

Please do not send us any requests that you are looking for a therapy place, for example. You can find the right facilities for you on our website and contact them yourself. We do not contact them for you.

## Do you accept donations?

With pleasure. We manage our donations transparently via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/transdb).
